## Problem Statement

We see that articles are present almost everywhere which convey a lot of information such as the news, events and information about latest technologies and innovation. Reader engaged with the articles has increased to a large extent compared to the 20th century where currently, they have access to the internet and people are able to gather content and read well.

One of the key things to note is that an user or a reader would be more engaged to those articles that are similar to the ones read earlier. Therefore, if we could come up with a technology that recommends users articles, this would ensure that the reader is engaged and is likely going to read other articles as well.
