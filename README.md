## Introduction

We see that articles are present almost everywhere which convey a lot of information such as the news, events and information about latest technologies and innovation. Reader engagement with the articles has increased to a large extent compared to the 20th century where currently, they have access to the internet and people are able to gather content and read well.

## Challenges

When a reader is going through an article, they might sometimes get bored and feel like not reading because the present article contains information that is beyond the comprehension of a reader to understand and interpret text compared to previous articles. Hence their interest would drop as a result of articles being dissimilar to the already read articles. 

One of the key things to note is that a user or a reader would be more engaged in those articles that are similar to the ones read earlier. Therefore, if we could come up with a technology that recommends users' articles, this would ensure that the reader is engaged and is likely going to read other articles as well. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This step plays a crucial role in machine learning by uncovering diverse patterns and trends within the data. By doing so, we gain valuable insights into the data's quality, including the presence of missing information, outliers, or inaccurate labels. Furthermore, this information enables us to effectively communicate specific data-related actions to the business, empowering them to take appropriate measures accordingly.

## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git which could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in the "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link to the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link to the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be an HTML link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone HTML" where the HTML is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the Jupyter notebook by writing "Jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
