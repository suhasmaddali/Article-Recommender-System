## Introduction

We see that articles are present almost everywhere which convey a lot of information such as the news, events and information about latest technologies and innovation. Reader engagement with the articles has increased to a large extent compared to the 20th century where currently, they have access to the internet and people are able to gather content and read well.

## Challenges

When a reader is going through an article, they might sometimes get bored and feel like not reading because the present article contains information that is beyond the comprehension of a reader to understand and interpret text compared to previous articles. Hence their interest would drop as a result of articles being dissimilar to the already read articles. 

One of the key things to note is that a user or a reader would be more engaged in those articles that are similar to the ones read earlier. Therefore, if we could come up with a technology that recommends users' articles, this would ensure that the reader is engaged and is likely going to read other articles as well.
